# Climate Change Analysis.
An SQL project on climate change and impact on agriculture

## Objectives
- Analyze the historical patterns of CO2 emissions across countries and identify contributors.
- To examine the relationship between temperature increase and CO2 emissions.
- To determine how soil quality affects agricultural productivity, which is important for food security under climate stress.
- To explore the agricultural practices in different regions and their long-term sustainability.

### Tools
SQL - Data cleaning and analysis

### Findings
The summary of analysis are as follows:
- Developed nations tend to have more stable or declining emissions after their peaks in the 2000s, while developing and emerging economies, show a clear upward trend in emissions.
- The average temperature has generally increased over the last decade, with some notable fluctuations, particularly peaking in 2018, but a more stable trend in recent years.
- Northeast and South regions face the highest frequency of extreme weather event

### How to Run the Queries
