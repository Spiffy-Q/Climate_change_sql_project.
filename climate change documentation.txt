climate change 

Step 1: Changed the data type of 'year' to INT
Reason: 'year' should be stored as an integer to support efficient numerical operations and comparisons.

Step 2: Changed the data type of 'country' to VARCHAR(100)
Reason: It will accommodate longer country names without data truncation.

Step 2: Changed the data type of 'crop_type' to VARCHAR(50)
Reason: To allow proper storage of crop type.

Step 1: Changed the data type of 'average_temperature_C' to DECIMAL(5,2)
Reason: To ensur precision for the temperature data, allowing two decimal places to better represent climate changes.

Step 2: Changed the data type of 'total_precipitation_mm' to DECIMAL(10,2)
Reason: This will ensure precise storage of data.

Step 2: Changed the data type of 'CO2_Emissions_mt' to DECIMAL(10,2)
Reason: To ensure more accurate and precise storage of data with up to two decimal places.
